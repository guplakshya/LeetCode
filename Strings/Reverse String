############## Reverse String ##############

/*

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.


Example:

Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]


*/

Java Solution:

public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int left =0 , right = s.length-1;
        while(left<right){
            char temp = s[left];
            s[left++] = s[right];
            s[right--] = temp;
        }
    }
